        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! My name is <strong>Rishabh Omar</strong>. I am an MCA student and a passionate sketch artist.
            Since childhood, I have always loved drawing and creating artistic designs. Art has been a beautiful
            part of my life and a way to express my emotions and creativity.
        </p>

        <p>
            Through this blog, I want to share my personal journey, experiences, struggles, achievements,
            and the lessons I learned from my passion for sketching. I hope my story inspires others to follow
            their dreams and believe in themselves.
        </p>

        <!-- MY STORY -->
        <h2>My Story</h2>

        <div class="post">

            <p>
                Since childhood, I have always loved creating things that made me happy. Whenever I liked something,
                I tried to draw it through sketching. I had a natural interest in drawing and creativity from an early age.
                I slowly started learning sketching by watching YouTube videos and practicing whenever I got time.
            </p>

            <p>
                At the end of 2019, when the lockdown began, everyone had to stay inside their homes. During this time,
                I often felt bored and empty, so I decided to seriously focus on portrait sketching. In the beginning,
                my drawings were not perfect — sometimes the facial proportions were incorrect or the features did not match properly.
                Still, I posted my sketches on Instagram and people started supporting and motivating me.
            </p>

            <p>
                Initially, I practiced by drawing portraits of my friends. Slowly, my confidence improved and I continued posting my work
                on Instagram and Facebook regularly. Many people appreciated my sketches, including my friends, family members,
                and even strangers. Some relatives who did not personally know me praised my work to my mother,
                which made me feel extremely proud and happy.
            </p>

            <p>
                My first paid order came when a girl liked my artwork and requested a portrait of her friend.
                I charged ₹350 for that sketch. Although the amount was small, it gave me immense happiness because
                it was my first earning through my art journey.
            </p>

            <p>
                To increase my reach, I started creating celebrity sketches which brought more engagement.
                I received appreciation from people across different countries. During the lockdown,
                I also started my own YouTube channel and uploaded a video of creating my self-portrait.
                Surprisingly, I gained 100 subscribers in just one day with the support of my friends and family.
            </p>

            <p>
                Throughout the lockdown period, I spent most of my time learning and improving my sketching skills.
                Some people believed that sketching was not a serious profession and often requested free artwork.
                Sometimes I agreed because sketching was my passion and brought me joy.
            </p>

            <p>
                As time passed, my family started worrying about my future career. Even I realized that long-term career
                opportunities in this field were limited. Therefore, by the end of 2022, I decided to stop pursuing sketching professionally.
            </p>

            <p>
                I prepared for NIMCET since my academic background was B.Sc Mathematics.
                Later, I secured admission to the University of Hyderabad for MCA and began a new academic journey.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, I am grateful that the skills I learned during the lockdown will always stay with me.
                Even today, whenever I create a sketch, it gives me immense happiness and confidence.
                The appreciation I receive from people motivates me deeply.
                Art will always remain a beautiful and meaningful part of my life. 🎨
